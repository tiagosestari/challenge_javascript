3. Feel free to make http calls as you prefer.
4. Feel free to use some UI / UX framework or make your own design.
5. When finished, pull request your challenge and then fork.
6. If you feel the need to "fail" some text on the screen that is not in the API (user name, photo, email, messages, etc.), no problem.
7. If you are unable to fork / pull request, forward the zipped repo to luciano@provi.com.br or padilha@provi.com.br
